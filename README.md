## Projects
### AI-Powered Emotion Recognition
[Project](https://github.com/NajLaBm/emotionDatection)

Designed a web application dedicated to the healthcare field. This AI-based application detects a patientâ€™s primary emotions to facilitate psychological diagnosis. Emotion detection is performed through the analysis of facial expressions, gestures, vocal tones, and text. I explored several deep learning techniques and used different models such as CNN, BiGRU, and BERT. Following the intelligent diagnosis, the tool generates a detailed psychological report in PDF format.
